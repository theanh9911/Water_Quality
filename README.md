# Build ML Model to Predict Water Potability

**Objective**
- The primary goal of this dataset is to evaluate and predict water potability based on various water quality parameters. It helps determine the safety and suitability of water sources for human consumption, supports decision-making in water treatment, and ensures compliance with established water quality standards.

**Machine Learning Task**
- This dataset is designed for a supervised binary classification task, where machine learning models are trained to classify water samples as either potable (1) or non-potable (0) based on the given water quality attributes.

**Data Applications**
- This dataset is valuable for assessing water quality, planning effective water treatment strategies, and ensuring safe drinking water. It can be used by water treatment facilities, environmental agencies, and researchers to make data-driven decisions regarding water potability and public health safety.
